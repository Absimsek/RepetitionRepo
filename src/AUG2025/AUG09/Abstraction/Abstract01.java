    //Abstract methods are methods that has no body inside

    // normally child classes can use parent class methods but it was not a must
    // when it comes to abstract method it will become a must to use that method

    //if a class is inherited and has an Abstract method than child class should override the abstract method
    //Means that all child classes of this parent class should include the abstract method.

    // if a class declared as abstract. object of it cannot be created
    // to have an abstract method, class also should be abstract

    //it is used when we want all common classes should do some certain thing so that it will be implemented

    //abstract methods can call to normal methods(concrete) but opposite way is impossible

    // Only if both parent and class are abstract classes then child can override parents method, but it is not must now
